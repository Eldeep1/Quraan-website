# Quraan-website
a website that contains the whole quraan 

# don't forget to run the sql files to have the database , and change your mysql password to 1234 or go to view/index.php and change password from 1234 to your mysql password.

# if you found that the layout is bad , just zoom out your screen untill you are satisfied 

# and saddly , you won't be able to use the full potential of the website cuz the audio files is stored locally on my pc , you can contact me to get it :)
using the power of HTML , CSS and JS , I have created quran website  where you can read any sura from your decision 

also I used php and mysql to get AYAT from the database and handle users choose of specefic sura ! 

I have done that site using MVC System Archticture !
